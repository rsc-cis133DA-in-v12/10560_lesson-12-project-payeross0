<!-- 
    There were many contrast errors throughout the whole page, so I made the text color darker. For the table headings and footer, I made the background lighter to contrast the new darker font color.
    I fixed the heading level to go in order from 1 to 2.
    I removed the font-size property to increase text size and readability.
    I added fieldsets and legends to each group of form inputs.
    I added labels to each input and textarea.
